# Salajeet & Dry Fruits Website

This is a complete and responsive website for a natural Salajeet and Dry Fruits online store. It is designed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. The purpose of this project is to showcase premium quality organic products like Salajeet and various dry fruits sourced directly from the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The website is ideal for local sellers who want to promote their products online with a modern and clean interface.

The homepage includes a beautiful banner, featured products, and highlights of the benefits of using natural Salajeet and dry fruits. Dedicated sections such as "About Us", "Our Products", and "Testimonials" help build trust and present information in a clear way.

One of the key features of this website is its **fully functional contact form**. The form allows users to send inquiries or orders directly to the store owner's email using a third-party service like Formspree or EmailJS. No backend server is needed, yet users can easily connect and send messages through the site.

The website also includes:

- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Interactive product cards with hover effects
- Smooth scroll and animation effects
- Organized folder structure for easy development

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Formspree (for email functionality)

This website is designed for frontend showcase purposes but can be extended to a full-stack e-commerce site. The code is clean, well-commented, and easy to modify for personal or commercial use.
